Balin is a browser automation library for Kotlin. It's basically a
Selenium-WebDriver wrapper inspired by Geb.


## Rationale

Geb is a wonderful library that allows its users exploit the power of the
Selenium-WebDriver API with incredible ease. As a software developer who spends
a lot of time working with browser automation, I've been lucky enough to work
with Geb and am now learning Kotlin. I'm taking this chance to learn this new
JVM-based language and to contribute to its ecosystem a tool that's very useful
to me.

## Usage

If you're curious about how to use this library, you can check out the
[following examples](src/test/kotlin/com/github/epadronu/balin/examples)

### Templates

The [Balin-Cucumber-TestNg-Allure](https://github.com/EPadronU/Balin-Cucumber-TestNg-Allure)
template can be of help in order to avoid the boilerplate required for Balin's
integration with the most common frameworks used in software testing.


## Documentation

JavaDoc and KDoc versions of Balin's API documentation can be found in the
following locations:

- [Java API](https://epadronu.github.io/balin/java/api/index.html)
- [Kotlin API](https://epadronu.github.io/balin/kotlin/api/balin/index.html)

## Note

This project has been conceived for research purposes but I don't dismiss the
possibility of making it a production-ready library if it gets to that point.
